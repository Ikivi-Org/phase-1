# Ikivi Mobile App Phase Finalization

Phase 1 of the Ikivi mobile app involves several tasks that need to be completed before the app can be launched on the App Store and Play Store.

These tasks include:

- Testing the entire app to identify and correct any bugs. These bugs may be related to UI/UX or functionality.
- Deploying the app to the App Store and Play Store.

Please note, that there are open issues in the mobile app repository that can provide guidance throughout this process.
